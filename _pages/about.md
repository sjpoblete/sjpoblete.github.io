I'm currently working as a Junior Researcher and Research Assistant at Pontificia Universidad Catolica de Chile (PUC--Chile). My main research interests lie in the fields of economics of education, labor economics, development economics and general applied microeconometrics. 
I try to answer questions in those fields with both empirical and theoretical tools.
